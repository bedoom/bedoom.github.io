Don't want to work hard for life, don't want to live in fear.

The sky turned dark and it began to rain for a long time.

The crowd outside was bustling, complaining of a hard day's work.

The boy beside him was indifferent and continued to do what he wanted to do.

When people see an anomaly, it is inevitable to denigrate a good man.

It was the best of times, full of superiority and confidence.

It's the worst of times. We're all bruised.

Don't care about the rain outside, open an umbrella, you will eventually become what you want to be.
